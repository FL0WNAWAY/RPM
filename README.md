This Streamlit app is designed to analyze respiratory traces (VXP files) from 4DCT scans.

- It visualizes the respiratory trace recorded during the 4DCT acquisition.
- It offers baseline drift correction and allows users to inspect detected peaks.
- For IBH or EBH treatments, the app enables amplitude gating threshold selection and visulization based on specified respiratory phases.
- It computes the duty cycle corresponding to the selected gating amplitude.
